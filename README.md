# Proxmox BPG Provider

`provider-proxmox-bpg` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider built using
[Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet). It exposes XRM-conformant managed
resources for the [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/) API.
## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-proxmox-bpg):
```
up ctp provider install provider-proxmox-bpg:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-proxmoxbpg
spec:
  package: crossplane/provider-proxmoxbpg:v0.1.0
EOF
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/valkiriaaquatica/provider-proxmox-bpg)

## Developing

Run code-generation pipeline:
```console
go run cmd/generator/main.go "$PWD"
```
Checkout sub-repositories:

```console
make submodules
```

Execute code generation:

```console
make generate
```


Run against a Kubernetes cluster:

Install the CRDs in the cluster:
```console
kubectl apply -f package/crds/
```

Run the image and keep this terminal to see the logs:
```console
make run
```

Build, push, and install:

## Reported Issues

As already mentioned [here](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent/blob/main/README.md), one workaround for broken or incomplete documentation files is to prepend the expected front matter to the file manually.

You can use the following Bash script to patch the file:

```bash
broken_doc_file=".work/bpg/proxmox/docs/resources/resource_with_error.md"

echo '--- 
# generated by https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
page_title: "resource_with_error Resource - terraform-provider-proxmox"
subcategory: ""
description: |-
  This resource creates and manages a Proxmox description of the resource.
---' | cat - "$broken_doc_file" > temp && mv temp "$broken_doc_file"
