# Proxmox BPG Provider

`provider-proxmox-bpg` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider built using
[Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet). It exposes XRM-conformant managed
resources for the [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/) API.
## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-proxmox-bpg):
```
up ctp provider install provider-proxmox-bpg:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-proxmoxbpg
spec:
  package: crossplane/provider-proxmoxbpg:v0.1.0
EOF
```


Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/valkiriaaquatica/provider-proxmox-bpg)

## Developing

### Fix for the make generate
When applying the make generate that does automatically docs, it pulls the /docs from the Terraform provider. As it's a know issue that can be found in other providers (see e.g: https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) we need to fix the README.md as for the moment it's a walkaround to skip this error: ../.work/bpg/proxmox/docs/resources/virtual_environment_acl.md: failed to find the prelude of the document using the xpath expressions: //text()[contains(., "description") and contains(., "page_title")". To fix it we need to do the following:




If you have devbox or want to work with it, it makes life easier for packages like go, do the following:
```console
cd devbox/
devbox install
devbox shell
```

Run code-generation pipeline:
```console
go run cmd/generator/main.go "$PWD"
```
Checkout sub-repositories:

```console
make submodules
```

Execute code generation:

```console
make generate
```


Run against a Kubernetes cluster:

Install the CRDs in the cluster:
```console
kubectl apply -f package/crds/
```

Run the image and keep this terminal to see the logs:
```console
make run
```

Build, push, and install:

```console
make all
```

Build binary:

```console
make build
```

## Reported Issues

As already mentioned [here](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-confluent/blob/main/README.md), one workaround for broken or incomplete documentation files is to prepend the expected front matter to the file manually.

You can use the following Bash script to patch the file:

```bash
broken_doc_file=".work/bpg/proxmox/docs/resources/resource_with_error.md"

echo '--- 
# generated by https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
page_title: "resource_with_error Resource - terraform-provider-proxmox"
subcategory: ""
description: |-
  This resource creates and manages a Proxmox description of the resource.
---' | cat - "$broken_doc_file" > temp && mv temp "$broken_doc_file"

## HOW TO TEST WITH ANOTHER TERRAFORM PROVIDER IN LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
  In case you need t test with your own forked terraform provider, some adjustes need to be take in charge.
  1. Fork the original terraform provider and make the changes u want. Follow the contriobution guide and check it exists on ls -l $(go env GOPATH)/bin/terraform-provider-proxmox
  2. After testing in local it works well we can place it on crossplane
  3. mkdir -p cluster/images/provider-proxmox-bpg/tempo_image
  4. Zip your terraform provider binary and copy the binary and the zip into cluster/images/provider-proxmox-bpg/tempo_image
  5. Comment the line "DD ${TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_DOWNLOAD_URL_PREFIX}/${TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_DOWNLOAD_NAME}_${TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_VERSION}_${TARGETOS}_${TARGETARCH}.zip /tmp"  in  cluster/images/provider-proxmox-bpg/Dockerfile and add this one: COPY tempo_image/terraform-provider-proxmox_0.78.1_linux_amd64.zip /tmp/   (make sure the version is correct)
